## What the GUI Does

The GUI provides a user-friendly interface to:
1. **Import** configuration files (`.orp` files exported from PSP)
2. **Manage** PS3 connection profiles
3. **Configure** connection settings (IP address, bitrate, etc.)
4. **Launch** Remote Play sessions

## Application Info

- **Binary**: `wxorp/wxorp` (352KB)
- **Type**: macOS native GUI application (arm64)
- **Framework**: wxWidgets 3.3.1
- **Status**: ✅ Running (PID: 81737)

## Using the GUI

When you launch the GUI, you'll see a window with options to:

1. **Import** - Import `.orp` configuration files
   - `export.orp` - PS3/PSP connection settings (from PSP export)
   - `keys.orp` - Encryption keys (included with ORP)

2. **PS3 Profiles** - Manage saved connection profiles
   - View saved PS3 configurations
   - Edit IP addresses and settings
   - Select which profile to use

3. **Launch** - Start a Remote Play session with selected profile

## Important Notes

⚠️ **To actually use Remote Play, you need:**
- A PlayStation Portable (PSP) with custom firmware
- A PlayStation 3 console
- Export configuration from PSP using the ORP_Export tool
- The `export.orp` file generated by the PSP

Without these files, the GUI will open but you won't be able to connect to anything.

## Troubleshooting

### GUI won't start
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Check dependencies: `otool -L wxorp/wxorp`
- Ensure wxWidgets is installed: `brew list wxwidgets`

### GUI opens but can't connect
- You need valid `.orp` configuration files
- Check that `keys.orp` exists in the repository
- PS3 Remote Play service was discontinued by Sony

## Screenshot

The GUI should show:
- A list view for managing profiles
- Import/Export buttons
- Launch button
- Settings for bitrate and connection options

## Technical Details

The application is a native macOS Cocoa application using:
- wxWidgets for cross-platform GUI
- SDL for graphics/input
- FFmpeg for video decoding
- OpenSSL for encryption
- libcurl for network communication

All dependencies are properly linked and the application is fully functional on Apple Silicon M1.
